In this folder, all the views including both Map function and Reduce function are
stored in corresponding database folders. As for list function, because they are
used in many views, there is no need to add them to each folder.

Almost all the views are introduced in the report view part (remove views in followers and politician are discussed in removal of duplicate tweets part.) Some
of views are not showed on report, because they are easily to understand or have
been introduced in the code file.
